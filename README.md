# Flavors-of-Cacao-
Using Python for Data Analysis 

This folder is to showcase Python Skills for Data Analysis.

In this project, it was used Python to: 
1. Combine dataframes
2. Perform data consistency
3. Perform data wrangling
4. Perform data analysis
5. Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning 
6. Create visualization

**Introduction**
 You’ll first conduct an exploratory visual
analysis in Python before identifying connections between variables worth further exploration. Then,
after developing hypotheses, you’ll use various advanced analytical approaches to help test them
before presenting your results in a Tableau dashboard/storyboard.
